How It Works
Search Process:
Recursive Directory Traversal: Uses Windows API to efficiently walk through directories

File Type Filtering: Automatically skips binary files and focuses on text-based formats

Content Search: Performs case-insensitive text matching within files

Progress Tracking: Shows search progress every 100 files

Results Collection: Stores found file paths for batch operations

File Operations:
Copy Files: Safe duplication to destination directory

Move Files: Relocation with safety warnings and confirmations

Unique Naming: Automatically handles filename conflicts

Directory Creation: Creates destination directories if needed

Performance
Memory Efficient: Minimal memory footprint during operation

Fast Search: Optimized file I/O and string matching

Large Directory Support: Handles directories with thousands of files

Progress Feedback: Regular updates during long operations

Safety Features
‚úÖ Move Operation Warnings: Clear warning messages before file relocation

‚úÖ User Confirmation: Additional "yes/no" prompt for destructive operations

‚úÖ File Existence Checks: Validates paths and file accessibility

‚úÖ Error Handling: Graceful handling of permission issues and I/O errors

‚úÖ Unique Filenames: Prevents overwriting existing files during copy/move

Technical Details
Architecture:
Pure Windows API: Uses FindFirstFile, FindNextFile for directory traversal

Efficient Memory Management: Manual memory allocation with proper cleanup

Case-Insensitive Matching: Converts both search text and file content to lowercase

Buffer Management: Optimized file reading with 8KB buffers

Compilation:
c
// Required libraries
#include <windows.h>

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
"Path does not exist" error

Ensure the path is spelled correctly

Use full paths (e.g., C:\Users\Name\Documents)

Permission errors

Run as Administrator if accessing protected directories

Check file/folder permissions

No files found

Verify search text is correct

Check if file types are in supported list

Try different casing (search is case-insensitive)

Build errors

Ensure Windows SDK is installed

Use compatible C compiler (MSVC or MinGW)
